abstract = {Abstract As the last time period when CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ concentrations were near 400 ppm, the Pliocene Epoch (5.33?2.58 Ma) is a useful paleoclimate target for understanding future climate change. Existing estimates of global warming and climate sensitivity during the Pliocene rely mainly on model simulations. To reconstruct Pliocene climate and incorporate paleoclimate observations, we use data assimilation to blend sea-surface temperature (SST) proxies with model simulations from the Pliocene Modeling Intercomparison Project 2 and the Community Earth System Models. The resulting reconstruction, ?plioDA,? suggests that the mid-Pliocene (3.25 Ma) was warmer than previously thought (on average 4.1°C warmer than preindustrial, 95% CI = 3.0°C?5.3°C), leading to a higher estimate of climate sensitivity (4.8°C per doubling of CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$, 90% CI = 2.6°C?9.9°C). In agreement with previous work, the tropical Pacific zonal SST gradient during the mid-Pliocene was moderately reduced (?0.8 ${-}0.8$°C, 95% CI = ?2.3 ${-}2.3$?0.4°C). However, this gradient was more reduced during the early Pliocene (4.75 Ma, ?2.3 ${-}2.3$°C, 95% CI = ?3.9 ${-}3.9$??1.1 ${-}1.1$°C), a time period that is also warmer than the mid-Pliocene (4.8°C above preindustrial, 95% CI = 3.6°C?6.2°C). PlioDA reconstructs a fresh North Pacific and salty North Atlantic, supporting Arctic gateway closure and contradicting the presence of Pacific Deep Water formation. Overall, plioDA updates our view of global and spatial climate change during the Pliocene, as well as raising questions about the state of ocean circulation and the drivers of differences between the early and mid-Pliocene.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Author(s). Methanesulfonic acid (MSA; CH3SO3H) in polar ice is a unique proxy of marine primary productivity, synoptic atmospheric transport, and regional sea-ice behavior. However, MSA can be mobile within the firn and ice matrix, a post-depositional process that is well known but poorly understood and documented, leading to uncertainties in the integrity of the MSA paleoclimatic signal. Here, we use a compilation of 22 ice core MSA records from Greenland and Antarctica and a model of soluble impurity transport in order to comprehensively investigate the vertical migration of MSA from summer layers, where MSA is originally deposited, to adjacent winter layers in polar ice. We find that the shallowest depth of MSA migration in our compilation varies over a wide range (∼2 to 400 m) and is positively correlated with snow accumulation rate and negatively correlated with ice concentration of NaC (typically the most abundant marine cation). Although the considered soluble impurity transport model provides a useful mechanistic framework for studying MSA migration, it remains limited by inadequate constraints on key physicochemical parameters-most notably, the diffusion coefficient of MSA in cold ice (DMS). We derive a simplified version of the model, which includes DMS as the sole parameter, in order to illuminate aspects of the migration process. Using this model, we show that the progressive phase alignment of MSA and NaC concentration peaks observed along a high-resolution West Antarctic core is most consistent with 10-12 m2 s-1 DMS 10-11 m-2 s-1, which is 1 order of magnitude greater than the DMS values previously estimated from laboratory studies. More generally, our data synthesis and model results suggest that (i) MSA migration may be fairly ubiquitous, particularly at coastal and (or) highaccumulation regions across Greenland and Antarctica; and (ii) can significantly change annual and multiyear MSA concentration averages. Thus, in most cases, caution should be exercised when interpreting polar ice core MSA records, although records that have undergone severe migration could still be useful for inferring decadal and lower-frequency climate variability.},

Yet the atmospheric history of CO2 remains uncertain in some time intervals. Here we present measurements of CO2 and methane (CH4) in the Skytrain ice core from 1450 to 1700 CE. Results suggest a sudden decrease in CO2 around 1610 CE in one widely used record may be an artefact of a small number of anomalously low values. Our analysis supports a more gradual decrease in CO2 of 0.5 ppm per decade from 1516 to 1670 CE, with an inferred land carbon sink of 2.6 PgC per decade. This corroborates modelled scenarios of large-scale reorganisation of land use in the Americas following New World-Old World contact, whereas a rapid decrease in CO2 at 1610 CE is incompatible with even the most extreme land-use change scenarios.},

abstract = {Marine phytoplankton have a crucial role in the modulation of marine-based food webs1, fishery yields2 and the global drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide3. However, owing to sparse measurements before satellite monitoring in the twenty-first century, the long-term response of planktonic stocks to climate forcing is unknown. Here, using a continuous, multi-century record of subarctic Atlantic marine productivity, we show that a marked 10 ± 7% decline in net primary productivity has occurred across this highly productive ocean basin over the past two centuries. We support this conclusion by the application of a marine-productivity proxy, established using the signal of the planktonic-derived aerosol methanesulfonic acid, which is commonly identified across an array of Greenlandic ice cores. Using contemporaneous satellite-era observations, we demonstrate the use of this signal as a robust and high-resolution proxy for past variations in spatially integrated marine productivity. We show that the initiation of declining subarctic Atlantic productivity broadly coincides with the onset of Arctic surface warming4, and that productivity strongly covaries with regional sea-surface temperatures and basin-wide gyre circulation strength over recent decades. Taken together, our results suggest that the decline in industrial-era productivity may be evidence of the predicted5 collapse of northern Atlantic planktonic stocks in response to a weakened Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation6–8. Continued weakening of this Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, as projected for the twenty-first century9,10, may therefore result in further productivity declines across this globally relevant region.},

abstract = {The North Atlantic jet stream impacts North American and European societies and is expected to be influenced by ongoing 21st-century warming. To better contextualize recently observed and model-projected jet stream changes, long-term records are required. We use insights from a state-of-the-art water isotope–enabled climate model and a compilation of ice-core records from Greenland to reconstruct mean annual North Atlantic jet stream changes back to the 8th century CE. Our reconstruction suggests that observed jet stream variations are consistent with natural variations, despite dramatic warming across recent decades. Under unabated future warming, however, a progressive migration of the jet stream northward is projected to render it distinct from natural variability by 2060 CE.Reconstruction of the North Atlantic jet stream (NAJ) presents a critical, albeit largely unconstrained, paleoclimatic target. Models suggest northward migration and changing variance of the NAJ under 21st-century warming scenarios, but assessing the significance of such projections is hindered by a lack of long-term observations. Here, we incorporate insights from an ensemble of last-millennium water isotope–enabled climate model simulations and a wide array of mean annual water isotope ($\delta$18O) and annually accumulated snowfall records from Greenland ice cores to reconstruct North Atlantic zonal-mean zonal winds back to the 8th century CE. Using this reconstruction we provide preobservational constraints on both annual mean NAJ position and intensity to show that late 20th- and early 21st-century NAJ variations were likely not unique relative to natural variability. Rather, insights from our 1,250 year reconstruction highlight the overwhelming role of natural variability in thus far masking the response of midlatitude atmospheric dynamics to anthropogenic forcing, consistent with recent large-ensemble transient modeling experiments. This masking is not projected to persist under high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, however, with model projected annual mean NAJ position emerging as distinct from the range of reconstructed natural variability by as early as 2060 CE.All new ice-core annual accumulation and water isotope time series presented herein, as well as NAJ reconstructions, are publicly available from the NOAA Paleoclimatology Data Archive (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/study/33773).

@article{Criscitiello2021,
abstract = {Abstract Sea ice plays a critical role in the Earth?s climate system, including influencing ocean heat uptake, reflecting solar radiation, and contributing to dense water formation. Instrumental records of polar sea ice extent are only available since 1979, however. The short length of such records also limits our knowledge of polynya variability, which can reflect large-scale atmospheric and climate changes. Ice core proxy records can extend these observations, but require further development and regional validation. We compare chloride and methanesulfonic acid concentrations from two new firn cores from the Canadian Arctic with satellite-derived observations of regional sea-ice concentration and polynya variability from 2002 to 2014. The sub-annual resolution of these cores allows for detailed investigation of how regional sea-ice concentration is recorded in the ice at Prince of Wales Icefield (POW), Ellesmere Island and Devon Ice Cap (DIC), Devon Island, Nunavut. Over the period 2002?2014 we find that the primary sources of marine aerosols to POW are polynyas within Arctic Canada and the Canada basin of the Arctic Ocean, whereas the primary sources of marine aerosols to DIC are a broader region of the Queen Elizabeth Islands, Baffin Bay, and the Arctic Ocean. Marine aerosol sources to the two core sites are distinct, reflecting different moisture source regions and, likely, differing transport pathways. Air mass back trajectory results support the satellite-derived results. Glaciochemical records from this dynamic, warming region may provide a proxy for reconstructing North Water polynya and other regional polynya and shore-lead variability prior to the satellite era.},

abstract = {A combination of 10Be surface-exposure dating of glacially transported boulders and glacially polished bedrock, and numerical modeling of the ∼600 km2 Late Pleistocene icefield complex in the northern Medicine Bow Mountains of Wyoming, USA, constrains the timing and climate forcing of the local last glacial maximum (LLGM) and the subsequent deglaciation in the range. The chronology reported here indicates initial recession of the ∼100 km2 Libby Creek glacier on the east side of the complex from its terminal moraine at 20.7 ± 2.8 ka, followed by length reduction of 38% by 18.0 ± 0.8 ka and 75% by 14.7 ± 0.4 ka. By 14.2 ± 0.3 ka, the icefield had nearly completely disappeared although there is evidence of two subsequent standstills or minor readvances at ∼11.5 ± 0.5 ka and ∼10.5 ± 0.3 ka. Results of numerical glacier-modeling experiments suggest that the LLGM was associated with temperatures 6.0 °C colder than present with an uncertainty of about ±1.7 °C, assuming no change from modern precipitation. If precipitation differed at the LLGM, over a range from half to twice modern, the temperature depression necessary to sustain the icefield complex could have been as much as 8.0 ± 1.7 °C or as little as 3.1 ± 1.7 °C respectively. As most available proxies and climate-model output suggest mildly decreased precipitation at the LLGM, a temperature depression of somewhat more than 6.0 °C is the most likely scenario. Model experiments further suggest that nearly complete deglaciation by 14.2 ± 0.3 ka involved only a ∼1.7 °C rise from LLGM temperature, assuming no change in precipitation. The sensitivity of the icefield complex to such limited warming reflects its plateau-like hypsometry, which makes it particularly sensitive to changing equilibrium-line altitude. While the precise chronology of deglaciation remains open to interpretation, most of the ice loss preceded the North Atlantic B{\o}lling-Aller{\o}d interval (∼14.7–12.9 ka), suggesting that global atmospheric CO2 and rising summer insolation were the dominant forcings of ice retreat.},

abstract = {Insoluble aerosol particles trapped in glacial ice provide insight into past climates, but analysis requires information on climatically relevant particle properties, such as size, abundance, and internal mixing. We present a new analytical method using a time-of-flight single-particle mass spectrometer (SPMS) to determine the composition and size of insoluble particles in glacial ice over an aerodynamic size range of ∼ 0.2-3.0$\mu$m diameter. Using samples from two Greenland ice cores, we developed a procedure to nebulize insoluble particles suspended in melted ice, evaporate condensed liquid from those particles, and transport them to the SPMS for analysis. We further determined size-dependent extraction and instrument transmission efficiencies to investigate the feasibility of determining particle-class-specific mass concentrations. We find SPMS can be used to provide constraints on the aerodynamic size, composition, and relative abundance of most insoluble particulate classes in ice core samples. We describe the importance of post-aqueous processing to particles, a process which occurs due to nebulization of aerosols from an aqueous suspension of originally soluble and insoluble aerosol components. This study represents an initial attempt to use SPMS as an emerging technique for the study of insoluble particulates in ice cores.},

Consistent analysis of temperature over the full Cenozoic era—including ‘slow' feedbacks by ice sheets and trace gases—supports this sensitivity and implies that CO2 was 300–350 ppm in the Pliocene and about 450 ppm at transition to a nearly ice-free planet, exposing unrealistic lethargy of ice sheet models. Equilibrium global warming for today's GHG amount is 10°C, which is reduced to 8°C by today's human-made aerosols. Equilibrium warming is not ‘committed' warming; rapid phaseout of GHG emissions would prevent most equilibrium warming from occurring. However, decline of aerosol emissions since 2010 should increase the 1970–2010 global warming rate of 0.18°C per decade to a post-2010 rate of at least 0.27°C per decade. Thus, under the present geopolitical approach to GHG emissions, global warming will exceed 1.5°C in the 2020s and 2°C before 2050. Impacts on people and nature will accelerate as global warming increases hydrologic (weather) extremes. The enormity of consequences demands a return to Holocene-level global temperature. Required actions include: (1) a global increasing price on GHG emissions accompanied by development of abundant, affordable, dispatchable clean energy, (2) East-West cooperation in a way that accommodates developing world needs, and (3) intervention with Earth's radiation imbalance to phase down today's massive human-made ‘geo-transformation' of Earth's climate.

We demonstrate that temperature variability across the past 24 thousand years was linked to two primary climatic mechanisms: radiative forcing from ice sheets and greenhouse gases; and a superposition of changes in the ocean overturning circulation and seasonal insolation. In contrast with previous proxy-based reconstructions6,7 our results show that global mean temperature has slightly but steadily warmed, by $\sim$0.5 °C, since the early Holocene (around 9 thousand years ago).

abstract = {Ice core archives are well suited for reconstructing rapid past climate changes at high latitudes. Despite this, few records currently exist from coastal Greenlandic ice caps due to their remote nature, limiting our long-term understanding of past maritime and coastal climate variability across this rapidly changing Arctic region. Here, we reconstruct regionally representative glacier surface mass balance and climate variability over the last two thousand years ($\sim$169–2015 ce) using an ice core collected from the Nuussuaq Peninsula, west Greenland. We find indications of abrupt regional hydroclimate shifts, including an up to 20% decrease in average snow accumulation during the transition from the Medieval Warm Period (950–1250 ce) to Little Ice Age (1450–1850 ce), followed by a subsequent >40% accumulation increase from the early 18th to late 20th centuries ce. These coastal changes are substantially larger than those previously reported from interior Greenland records. Moreover, we show that the strong relationship observed today between Arctic temperature rise and coastal ice cap decay contrasts with that of the last millennium, during which periods of warming led to snowfall-driven glacial growth. Taken together with modern observations, the ice core evidence could indicate a recent reversal in the response of west Greenland ice caps to climate change.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Nature Limited.  The Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) is a growing contributor to global sea-level rise 1 , with recent ice mass loss dominated by surface meltwater runoff 2,3 . Satellite observations reveal positive trends in GrIS surface melt extent 4 , but melt variability, intensity and runoff remain uncertain before the satellite era. Here we present the first continuous, multi-century and observationally constrained record of GrIS surface melt intensity and runoff, revealing that the magnitude of recent GrIS melting is exceptional over at least the last 350 years. We develop this record through stratigraphic analysis of central west Greenland ice cores, and demonstrate that measurements of refrozen melt layers in percolation zone ice cores can be used to quantifiably, and reproducibly, reconstruct past melt rates. We show significant (P < 0.01) and spatially extensive correlations between these ice-core-derived melt records and modelled melt rates 5,6 and satellite-derived melt duration 4 across Greenland more broadly, enabling the reconstruction of past ice-sheet-scale surface melt intensity and runoff. We find that the initiation of increases in GrIS melting closely follow the onset of industrial-era Arctic warming in the mid-1800s, but that the magnitude of GrIS melting has only recently emerged beyond the range of natural variability. Owing to a nonlinear response of surface melting to increasing summer air temperatures, continued atmospheric warming will lead to rapid increases in GrIS runoff and sea-level contributions.},

abstract = {Abstract The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key feature of the North Atlantic with global ocean impacts. The AMOC's response to past changes in forcings during the Holocene provides important context for the coming centuries. Here, we investigate AMOC trends using an emerging set of transient simulations using multiple global climate models for the past 6,000 years. Although some models show changes, no consistent trend in overall AMOC strength during the mid-to-late Holocene emerges from the ensemble. We interpret this result to suggest no overall change in AMOC, which fits with our assessment of available proxy reconstructions. The decadal variability of the AMOC does not change in ensemble during the mid- and late-Holocene. There are interesting AMOC changes seen in the early Holocene, but their nature depends a lot on which inputs are used to drive the experiment.},

@article{Cooper2025,
abstract = {Here, we show that the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) provides a stronger constraint on equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), the global warming from increasing greenhouse gases, after accounting for temperature patterns. Feedbacks governing ECS depend on spatial patterns of surface temperature (?pattern effects?); hence, using the LGM to constrain future warming requires quantifying how temperature patterns produce different feedbacks during LGM cooling versus modern-day warming. Combining data assimilation reconstructions with atmospheric models, we show that the climate is more sensitive to LGM forcing because ice sheets amplify extratropical cooling where feedbacks are destabilizing. Accounting for LGM pattern effects yields a median modern-day ECS of 2.4°C, 66% range 1.7° to 3.5°C (1.4° to 5.0°C, 5 to 95%), from LGM evidence alone. Combining the LGM with other lines of evidence, the best estimate becomes 2.9°C, 66% range 2.4° to 3.5°C (2.1° to 4.1°C, 5 to 95%), substantially narrowing uncertainty compared to recent assessments. Ice sheet?driven temperature patterns amplified glacial cooling, implying less future warming than previously estimated.},

@article{Fu2025,
abstract = {Abstract Sea ice plays multiple important roles in regulating the global climate. Rapid sea ice loss in the Arctic has been documented over recent decades, yet our understanding of long-term sea ice variability and its feedbacks remains limited by a lack of quantitative sea ice reconstructions. The sea ice diatom-derived biomarker IP25 ${\text{IP}}_{25}$ has been combined with sterols produced by open-water phytoplankton in the PIP25 ${\text{PIP}}_{25}$ index as a sea ice proxy to achieve semi-quantitative reconstructions. Here, we analyze a compilation of over 600 published core-top measurements of IP25 ${\text{IP}}_{25}$ paired with brassicasterol and/or dinosterol across (sub-)Arctic oceans to calculate a newln(PIP25 ${\text{PIP}}_{25}$) index that correlates nonlinearly with sea ice concentration. Leveraging sediment trap and sea ice observational studies, we develop a spatially varying Bayesian calibration (BaySIC) for ln(PIP25 ${\text{PIP}}_{25}$) to account for its non-stationary relationship with sea ice concentration and other environmental drivers (e.g., sea surface salinity). The model is fully invertible, allowing probabilistic forward modeling of the ln(PIP25 ${\text{PIP}}_{25}$) index as well as inverse modeling of past sea ice concentration with bi-directional uncertainty quantification. BaySIC facilitates direct proxy-model comparisons and palaeoclimate data assimilation, providing the polar proxy constraints currently missing in climate model simulations and enabling, for the first time, fully quantitative Arctic sea ice reconstructions.},

@article{Scoto2024,
abstract = {Bromine in ice cores has been proposed as a qualitative sea ice proxy to produce sea ice reconstructions for the polar regions. Here we report the first statistical validation of this proxy with satellite sea ice observations by combining bromine enrichment (with respect to seawater, Brenr) records from three Greenlandic ice cores (SIGMA-A, NU and RECAP) with satellite sea ice imagery, over three decades. We find that during the 1984–2016 satellite-era, ice core Brenr values are significantly correlated with first-year sea ice formed in the Baffin Bay and Labrador Sea supporting that the gas-phase bromine enrichment processes, preferentially occurring over the sea ice surface, are the main driver for the Brenr signal in ice cores. Moreover, in assessing Brenr's capability to record historical sea ice variability, we compare 20th-century Arctic Sea ice historical and proxy records with our reconstructions, based on an autoregressive–moving-average (ARMA) model, finding overall good agreement. While further enhancements are warranted, including site-specific calibrations and a comprehensive investigation into bromine transport-related concerns, this study presents a new method to quantitatively reconstruct past seasonal sea ice variability through bromine enrichment in ice cores.},

@article{Osman_PhD_thesis,
  title={Greenlandic ice archives of North Atlantic Common Era climate},
  abstract={The Common Era (A.D. 1- present) represents a crucial period for climatic studies, documenting the timespan over which human activities have become an increasingly domineering force in shaping Earth's landscape, climate, and ecology. Direct, quantifiable records of climatic phenomena are severely limited over much of the Common Era, necessitating high-resolution, naturally-derived proxies to extend climatic insights beyond the satellite and instrumental era, particularly across remote high-latitude and maritime regions of the North Atlantic. Here, I use modem, data-driven and physically-based modeling approaches to gain new insights into North Atlantic climate variability from the Greenlandic ice core archive. First, I investigate the climatic fidelity of ice core glaciochemical climate proxies at the microphysical-scale.
  I show that several soluble chemical species - key among them methanesulfonic acid (MSA) - undergo rapid vertical migration through a super-cooled liquid-advection process along ice crystal grain-boundaries. I demonstrate that significant multi-year MSA changes occur only under low snow-accumulation and high-impurity-content conditions, thus mitigating the phenomenon over much of Greenland. Building upon these findings, I then investigate the cause of declining 19th and 20th-century MSA concentrations across the interior Greenland Ice Sheet. My results illustrate that Greenlandic MSA records provide a new proxy for North Atlantic planktonic biomass changes, illuminating a 10 ± 7\%} decline in marine productivity over the Industrial-era. I next present a new climate record from a previously-unexplored coastal ice cap in west-central Greenland.
  Using a physically-constrained ice cap flowline inversion model, I identify marked centennial-scale changes in coastal precipitation during the last millennium, including a ~40\%} increase in coastal precipitation since the industrial-onset. These changes are drastically larger than those observed from inland Greenland records, revealing enhanced sensitivity in west Greenlandic hydroclimates to regional Atlantic and Arctic-wide temperature variability. Finally, leveraging a compilation of nearly 30 annual-resolution Greenland water-isotope records, I isolate coherent signatures of atmospheric circulation variability to reconstruct changes in the North Atlantic eddy-driven jet-stream over the last millennium, exposing progressively enhanced variability during the past two-centuries consistent with amplified Arctic thermal-wind forcing.
  This thesis thus illuminates new Common Era climatic and ecologic changes, and expands the scope of the Greenlandic ice archive as proxies of the coupled North Atlantic climate system.},

   abstract={Reconstructions of past climates in both time and space provide important insight into the range and rate of change within the climate system. However, producing a coherent global picture of past climates is difficult because indicators of past environmental changes (proxy data) are unevenly distributed and uncertain. In recent years, paleoclimate data assimilation (paleoDA), which statistically combines model simulations with proxy data, has become an increasingly popular reconstruction method. Here, we describe advances in paleoDA to date, with a focus on the offline ensemble Kalman filter and the insights into climate change that this method affords. PaleoDA has considerable strengths in that it can blend multiple types of information while also propagating uncertainty. Drawbacks of the methodology include an overreliance on the climate model and variance loss. We conclude with an outlook on possible expansions and improvements in paleoDA that can be made in the upcoming years.},
