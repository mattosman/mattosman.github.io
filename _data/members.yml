    I’m interested in Earth's climate system: how it operates, changes, interacts,
    and dissociates through time. This system is both fascinating and complex ... but
    understanding its vitality and stability is also crucial to sustaining
    life as we know it.

    I help run [**C3PO**](/about_c3po/) by mobilising talented and creative individuals ---
    those listed below --- to tackle "big picture" science problems. We focus on interesting
    and relevant questions that have potential to improve understanding of how Earth’s climate
    changes.

    I’m a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Geography, Cambridge,
    working in collaboration with Downing College and the [**Cambridge Centre
    for Climate Repair**](https://www.climaterepair.cam.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}. I am
    interested in abrupt climate transitions and feedback processes that either amplify or
    diminish climate change and its impacts. My current aim is to reconstruct past changes
    in the global carbon cycle by combining earth system model simulations with climate proxy
    records from across the globe.

    I completed my undergraduate studies in Geosciences and Astrophysics at Jacobs University Bremen,
    followed by an MSc in Oceanography at the University of Maine and a PhD in Climate Science at
    the University of New South Wales. I then undertook a postdoc position at the École Normale
    Supérieure – PSL before joining the University of Cambridge in 2024.

    I am a PhD student in the Department of Geography, where I'm affiliated with the [**Cambridge Centre
    for Climate Repair**](https://www.climaterepair.cam.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}. My PhD focuses
    on developing physically consistent and dynamically verifiable reconstructions of the Atlantic
    Meridional Overturning Circulation (i.e., AMOC) that allow for direct comparison with
    observations.  My research draws on large-ensemble climate model output, global compilations
    of proxy records, and advanced statistical techniques. Using these tools, I investigate
    past AMOC variability and its interactions with other components of the climate system
    within and beyond the North Atlantic.  I am broadly interested in the coupled behaviour
    of the ocean, atmosphere, and cryosphere; studying any one element in isolation risks
    overlooking the feedbacks of the climate system as a whole.

    Before coming to Cambridge, I received my B.S. in Atmospheric Sciences
    in China, where I investigated how state-of-the-art climate models simulate the
    behaviour of Asian summer monsoon. When I am not coding or pouring over climate
    data, I perform as the lead vocalist and guitarist of a Cambridge-based
    rock band and row with a local club on the River Cam.

    I'm a PhD student in the Department of Geography and Scott Polar Research Institute
    ([**SPRI**](https://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}),
    researching Arctic sea ice sensitivity – how responsive the ice cover is to changes in forcings,
    particularly in light of its recent rapid decline. My work integrates geological records with
    climate models to investigate  long-term variations in Arctic sea ice, especially during past warm periods,
    in order to  better understand feedback processes and improve future climate projections. When I’m not
    puzzling over our complex planet, you'll usually find me outdoors looking for cool rocks and/or cute cats.

    I am a data scientist specialised in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and my
    research focuses on climate change, extreme weather and public health. Working as
    a Research Assistant in the nutrition group of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
    Medicine, I developed a keen interest in bridging gaps in methods and data between climate- and
    health-related disciplines. This led me to pursue a PhD with the University of Cambridge
    Geography Department, where I am supervised by a diverse team of supervisors from
    the British Antarctic Survey, Judge Business School and Met Office. My thesis aims to
    provide early warning predictions of extreme weather impacts on health care in the UK and India.
    In my spare time, I volunteer with MapAction to provide cartographic expertise for disaster
    response. When I am not travelling, I enjoy reading, cooking and exercising.

    I am a PhD student on the AI for the Study of Environmental Risks ([**AI4ER**](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"})
    programme, jointly based at the British Antarctic Survey and the Department of Geography (Cambridge).
    I am particularly interested in applying AI and machine‑learning methods to reconstructed
    and modelled climate data to uncover climate dynamics. My doctoral project develops
    causal models to untangle the mechanisms behind major ice age climate reorganisations ---
    for example, the last deglaciation and Dansgaard–Oeschger events --- by combining palaeoclimate
    records with machine‑learning‑based causal inference. My work aims to clarify how past
    changes in ocean circulation, atmospheric CO₂ and ice‑sheet dynamics interacted, ultimately
    improving our ability to anticipate future abrupt climate change.

    Before starting my PhD, I earned an MRes with distinction in Environmental Data Science
    at the University of Cambridge, where I used Gaussian Mixture Models to map Arctic
    Ocean water masses beneath sea ice and helped build a deep‑learning pipeline to predict
    hurricane damage to buildings. Earlier, I worked as a research assistant at Shantou University and
    completed an MSc in Geography and a BSc in Geophysics at the China University of Geosciences.
    My PhD is funded by a UKRI studentship.

    I engage with palaeoclimate questions as a lens through which to interrogate
    the human past and our potential future. I enjoy thinking across marine, terrestrial
    and ice core archives. During my undergraduate studies in Geography, I worked on a
    'sortable silt' flow speed reconstruction of the Norwegian Sea during the last
    deglaciation. I was then awarded an EFG scholarship (King's College) to pursue
    an MPhil in [*Quantitative Climate and Environmental Science*](https://qces.uk/){:target="\_blank"}, where I am researching
    Asian monsoon dynamics during the last interglacial period using isotope-enabled Earth
    System Models. My PhD research (starting 2025) will use Antarctic and Greenland ice
    cores to constrain the interglacial evolution of methane, exploring the role of
    ancient agriculture in changing global environments.

    In my free time, I paint watercolour landscapes of the places I visit during fieldwork.

    I am an MRes student and [**Gates Cambridge **](https://www.gatescambridge.org/){:target="\_blank"} scholar
    in the Department of Geography here at Cambridge, where my research
    focuses on reconstructing and understanding the Marine Isotope Stage 11 (MIS11) "super-interglacial"
    using climate proxies and models. More broadly, however, I am interested in understanding the fundamental
    differences between past periods of global-scale warming, and in reducing model uncertainties in predicting
    the impacts of anthropogenic climate change using evidence from the past.

    Growing up just outside New Orleans, I developed an appreciation for the
    urgency of climate change, which led me to pursue a B.S. in Environmental Earth Science
    with a minor in Marine Biology at Tulane University. I feel fortunate to be here in Cambridge,
    and to have discovered my passion for using clues from the past to better understand our planet’s future.
    When I’m not thinking about MIS11, you can usually find me watching an episode of Parts Unknown,
    listening to Ethiopian jazz, or spending time outdoors with friends.

    I’m a geography undergraduate at the University of Cambridge with a strong passion
    for climate science and numerical modeling. My current research focuses on modeling and
    data assimilation to investigate ice–climate coupling during abrupt climate transitions.
    My interest in climate dynamics began in secondary school when I was captivated by
    Richard Alley’s The Two-Mile Time Machine, but it was during my first-year here at Cambridge,
    learning about energy balance dynamics, that I confirmed climate modeling was what I wanted
    to pursue. Since then, I’ve been developing my own climate models both within and beyond coursework.

    I am particularly fascinated by feedbacks and couplings in the Earth system, especially
    during past abrupt events such as Dansgaard–Oeschger and Heinrich events. These rapid
    transitions are critical for understanding future climate thresholds; I'm interested in
    understanding their mechanisms through physically grounded models and comparison with proxy data.
    Outside of academics, I enjoy stargazing, hiking, and sunbathing with my two cats.
