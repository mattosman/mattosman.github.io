I am an Assistant Professor at the <b>[University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}</b>, where I run the [<i>Cambridge Computational Climatology and Paleoceanography</i>]({{ '/about_c3po/' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}) lab (<b>[C3PO]({{ '/about_c3po/' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})</b>).  

My work seeks to understand how and why Earth’s climate changes across seasonal- to millennial-timescales.  I study the past to better understand our climatic future.  
<!-- I am fascinated by the intersection of climate across human and ecologic dimensions, during the past and into the present. -->

One major theme of my work has been developing new quantitative approaches to understand climate dynamics using naturally derived "proxies".  I aim for a holistic approach by combining proxies with modern observations, statistical models, and climate simulations.

Previously, I received my PhD in climate science at the <b>[Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://eapsweb.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"}</b> and <b>[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu/){:target="\_blank"}</b>, and worked as a researcher at the <b>[University of Arizona](https://www.climatesystemscenter.org/){:target="\_blank"}</b>.
