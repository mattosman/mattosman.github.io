<!-- # Cambridge Computational Climatology and Paleoceanography group  -->

Welcome! We are the Cambridge Computational Climatology and PaleOceanography (**C3PO** <img src='/assets/img/c3po.png' style='height: 20px; vertical-align: middle;'><sup>*</sup>) group at the University of Cambridge.

**Our research explores past, present, and future climate change.**  Our work spans sub-seasonal to millennial time intervals, and spatial scales ranging from global down to local. We integrate diverse climate "observations" -- measurements ranging from sparsely situated paleo-proxies up to modern satellite data -- with mathematical tools to better understand Earth’s climate system in statistically sound, mechanistically grounded ways.

**A central aim of our group is to quantitatively leverage past climate changes to contextualise modern observations and constrain future projections.** We specialise in bridging climate proxies and global climate model simulations; in applying and developing paleoclimate data assimilation techniques; in building statistical models; and in deciphering climate feedbacks through models and observations.

Some of our ongoing research themes include:
- *Past global temperature reconstruction* (e.g., Mid-Pliocene Warm Period, Last Interglacial, Last Glacial Maximum, Holocene, Marine Isotope Stage 11)
- *Polar change and proxy system development* (e.g., sea ice dynamics, ocean circulation, ice-ocean-atmosphere coupling)
- *Cryosphere–climate coupling* (e.g., ice sheet sensitivity, coastal Greenland ice changes)
- *Statistical model development* (e.g., causal inference, age-depth modelling, dynamical time series modelling)

We're fortunate to collaborate frequently with researchers from across Cambridge and internationally, including through the British Antarctic Survey and the (forthcoming) CMIP7 Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project.

### Ongoing projects

Some current topics that our students and collaborators are working on include:
- Understanding Arctic sea ice dynamics and sensitivity across timescales using statistical learning
- Reconstructing past interglacial warm periods and ice sheet sensitivity (e.g., LIG, MIS11, MIS31)
- Causal inference for large-scale climate reorganisations
- Westerly wind dynamics during past warm periods
- Data assimilation of the paleoclimate carbon cycle
- Reconstructing AMOC variability using models, proxies, and statistics
- Forecasting climate and weather-related hospital admissions
- Investigating hydroclimate dynamics across past warm and cold intervals -->
