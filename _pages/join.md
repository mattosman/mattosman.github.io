# Join the C3PO group! <img src='/assets/img/c3po.png' style='height: 60px; vertical-align: middle;'><sup>*</sup>

We are **always** excited to hear from prospective students, postdoctoral researchers, and visitors interested in quantitative, multidisciplinary, and curiosity-driven climate science.

Diversity of backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences strengthens our science, and we especially need *everyone’s* unique insights to address the climate crisis.  We are thus strongly committed to maintaining a supportive, collaborative, and inclusive environment.  C3PO welcomes applicants from all races, ethnicities, religions, nationalities, genders, identities, ages, affiliations, orientations, and/or disability statuses.

If you are passionate about using quantitative methods to understand the climate system —-- past, present, and future —-- please get in touch to schedule a meeting to discuss aligned aims.

## PhD Students

We actively encourage inquiries from prospective PhD students excited about topics in paleoclimate, data assimilation, climate dynamics, and/or climate sensitivity.

Students can apply through the [*Department of Geography PhD Program*](https://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/postgraduate/phd/). We advertise projects each year through the [**Cambridge NERC Doctoral Landscape Awards (DLA)**](https://nercdtp.esc.cam.ac.uk/); we also frequently co-supervise students at the [*British Antarctic Survey*](https://www.bas.ac.uk/science/science-and-students/nerc-doctoral-training-opportunities/) through their PhD track in Antarctic Studies.

Key funding timelines (see [**here**](https://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/postgraduate/phd/) for up-to-date deadlines):
- *October* for the [Gates Cambridge Scholarship](https://www.gatescambridge.org/)
- *Early December* to be competitive for most internal University / College funding pools (highly recommended)
- *January* for the NERC DLA PhD projects

Prospective students are encouraged to get in contact well in advance of these deadlines to discuss potential projects.

## Postdocs

We currently do not have any advertised positions (though please check back in the coming months).  However, we are always happy to discuss postdoctoral opportunities with motivated researchers who have strong backgrounds in climate science, statistical / data science, or related fields.

Potential researchers are especially encouraged to propose project ideas that may be formulated as external fellowship applications (e.g., NERC, Royal Society, Leverhulme, Marie Curie -- see below). Cambridge colleges also individually offer various funding opportunities; these can be rather opaque but some general information can be found [**here**](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/fellowship-schemes).

Several external fellowship options (see [**this**](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/fellowship-schemes) nice synthesis):
- [*Royal Society Newton International Fellowship*](https://royalsociety.org/grants/newton-international/) (for international applicants)
- [*Royal Society Fellowships University Research Fellowships*](https://royalsociety.org/grants/newton-international/) (for domestic applicants)
- [*Royal Society Career Development Fellowship (CDF)*](https://royalsociety.org/grants/career-development-fellowship/) (for underrepresented backgrounds)
- [*NERC Independent Research Fellowship*](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/developing-people-and-skills/nerc/nerc-fellowships/) (for domestic applicants)
- [*Horizon Europe Marie Sklodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowships*](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships)
- [*Leverhulme Early Career Fellowships*](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/early-career-fellowships)
- [*Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 research fellowships*](https://royalcommission1851.org/fellowships/research-fellowships)

If interested, please email Matt (<i class="fa fa-envelope"></i> *mo549 (at) cam.ac.edu*) with a CV, a brief statement of research interests, and proposed timeline to discuss funding options.

## MPhil Students

We encourage inquiries from students in the following MPhil programs:
- [*Holocene Climates MPhil*](https://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/postgraduate/mphil/holocene/)
- [*Polar Studies MPhil*](https://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/postgraduate/mphil/)
- [*Quantitative Climate and Environmental Science (QCES) MPhil*](https://qces.uk/)

Students with strong quantitative backgrounds are particularly encouraged to get in touch to discuss potential research projects.  Generally speaking, projects we are able to host will be advertised internally.

## Cambridge undergraduates

We welcome inquiries from undergraduate students interested in diving headfirst into rigorous climate research. In particular, 2nd-year undergraduates in Cambridge Geography looking to develop 3rd-year dissertation topics are encouraged to reach out.

If interested, please send a short statement of interest and a CV to Matt to schedule a meeting (<i class="fa fa-envelope"></i> *mo549 (at) cam.ac.edu*).

## Visitors

We are happy to host visiting students, researchers, or academics on sabbatical (subject to space).  If you are interested in arranging a visit, particularly if you're contributing personal funds to do so, please reach out well in advance with a short description of your research plans.

Established researchers in Paleoclimatology may be interested in the following (lucrative) visiting scholar scheme at Cambridge: [**The Sir Nicholas Shackleton Fellowship**](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/the-sir-nicholas-shackleton-fellowship/)
